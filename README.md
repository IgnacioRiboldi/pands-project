# pands-project
Personal project for Programming and Scripting

On this README you could find all the sources used to prepare my final project.

## Task

The main task was to analyse the iris Data Set. 

## Development

During this final project I was able to show some knoledge of the coding we were practicing during this subject.
At the beggining I could say it was not very difficult since we were using a data frame that we worked with in another subject (Principle of data analytics).
Mixing some previous code and with help of different source I manage to prepare this small project.
The first two task were ok, since we were told what to do, but when we got the freedom to perform some extras analysis I went blank, we saw many graphics that I was´t completely sure of wich one would be better for this data.
I decided to add the presentation of the Feature Names and Classes, I felt was something important to introduce this steps before showing all the analysis since It would give a little overview of what is comming after.
Also, I decided to add a line graphic, comparing each feature of each of the classes.
I searched for porjects from different students, and I don´t feel their analysis is much extensive or relevant, but I will still thinking about any possible idea I can introduce to the project before the dead line.
Codes where created in different programs and then merged in one as practiced on previous clases, however, I still have a feeling that there is extra code that could be delete it.

## Result

Run this code using " python .\analysis.py " and it will create a txt file where you can find a summary of the data set.
After that It will print and save one histogram for each feature of the data set and just print (not save) a line graphic that compares each feature of each species.


## Sources

Iris Data Set :

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris

This data set contains data and characteristics from 3 different types of Iris Species, also contains data of the length and width of their sepal and Petal.

https://seaborn.pydata.org/ Seaborn is a very complete librery at the time of data analytics, thanks to this I was able to create most of the graphics on this project.

Scatter plot:

https://matplotlib.org/  - https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/scatterplot_matrix.html - For the scatter plot I used a mix of seaborn (create the histogram) and matplotlib (edit title and labels and show and save.)

Pandas:

https://pandas.pydata.org/ - Used to import iris data set.
