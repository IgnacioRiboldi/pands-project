analysis.py
Using some previous information received on classes and support from below websites, I manage to create the first excerise of this project.

Run this code using " python .\analysis.py " and it will create a txt file where you can find a summary of the data set.
After that It will print and save one histogram for each feature of the data set and just print (not save) a Scatter plot.
